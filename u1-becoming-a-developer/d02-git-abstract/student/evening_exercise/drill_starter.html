  // YOUR SOLUTIONS START HERE!

  // 1. Pythagorean Theorem
  var a, b, c;
  a = parseInt(prompt("What is the length of the 1st side?"));
  b = parseInt(prompt("What is the length of the 2nd side?"));
  c = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2));

  alert("The total length of the triangle with sides of length " + a + " and " + b + " is " + c + ".");

// 2. Basic Conversion
var lbs, klg;
lbs = parseInt(prompt("What is your weight in pounds?"));
klg = (lbs * 0.453592);

alert(lbs + " pounds is equal to " + klg + " kg.");

// 3. Killer Caffeine
var weight, death, cups;
weight = parseInt(prompt("What is your weight (in lbs)?"));
death = (weight/100)*6000;
cups = death/95;

alert("You will DIE if you drink " + cups + " cups of coffee.");

// // 4. Old Modems
var movie, modem, time;

modem = 56;
time = movie/modem;
alert("#4: It will take " + time + " seconds to download Blade Runner on a 56k/s modem.  That's over 41 days. Yikes!");

// 5. A Long Long Long Time

var dist, mph, timeOnRoad, cdRuns;
dist = 3188;
mph = 55;
timeOnRoad = dist/mph;
cdRuns = timeOnRoad/1.556;

alert("#5: If you really love the Beetles that much, you can listen to their White album " + cdRuns + " times on your roadtrip.");
