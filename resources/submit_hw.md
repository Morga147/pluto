# Submitting Homework

Do the following from somewhere within your `code/wdi/pluto` directory.

1. Whenever you have completed a meaningful chunk of work:

```bash
# ~/code/wdi/pluto/u2-how-the-internet-works
git add -A :/
git commit -m 'submitting hw for w01d05 (or whatever week and day the hw was assigned)'
```

2. When you're finished for the night, submit your HW

```bash
submit_hw
```
