## TA Hours

A TA (Jon "The Yellow Dart" Eddy) will be available on site for help on Monday through Thursday from 6 to 9.

The Instructional Team does not have office hours. During the course each
instructor will have have several scheduled 1v1 pairing sessions with students.
Schedule TBD.

## Queing for Help

Our TA uses a chatbot to manage student questions at night.  The queue operates on a first asked first answered basis.

Send a **private message** to Charon the class chatbot in the format:

```
queue me for help with HELP_NEEDED
```

Where `HELP_NEEDED` is a detailed explaination of your problem.

A more detailed message will allow our TA better understand your problem or
identify if other students are having the same problem.
