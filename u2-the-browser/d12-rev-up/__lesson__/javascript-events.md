# Events

## Learning Objectives
- understand the difference between native javascript and jQuery event objects are not the same
- use event delegation and its benefits

## Intro
When we were previously learned about event handlers there is a event parameter that is passed
into the callback function. Does anyone know what is that event parameter?
It's an object and we can see that if we log it out.

We learned about event.preventDefault()
